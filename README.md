## General Information
This case study is about a lending Club. We analyse the data and detect a pattern to minimise the risk of losing money when lending to customers.

When the company receives a loan application, the company has to make a decision for loan approval based on the applicant’s profile. Two types of risks are associated with the bank’s decision:
- If the applicant is likely to repay the loan, then not approving the loan results in a loss of business to the company.
- If the applicant is not likely to repay the loan, i.e. he/she is likely to default, then approving the loan may lead to a financial loss for the company.
In this case study, we will use *Exploratory Data Analysis* to understand how consumer attributes and loan attributes influence the tendency of default.

**Business Objectives:**
- To understand the driving factors behind loan default. To identify wheather the applicant will default or not.
**DataSet**
- The data set used here is of US orginand is attached here. It contains various variables related to banking sector such as DTI, annual income, loan amount etc fromthe year 2007 to 2011.
